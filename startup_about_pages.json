Become a Partner Become a Partner Vecta X Agent IQ Discove R Code Prism Our Story Our Story Mirror Security started in May 2024, built on Dr. Aditya Narayanaâs research into AI Security and years spent building large language models and security systems for high-stakes environments. From both the research side and the product side, we kept running into the same issue: to use AI properly, organizations were being asked to let their most sensitive data â and the intelligence built on top of it, flow into external models and infrastructure they didnât fully control. We started Mirror Security to change that. Our focus is simple: run AI where the sensitive data already lives, keep it encrypted end to end, and ensure the patterns, signals, and decision logic it reveals stay under the ownerâs control. Working with regulated and sovereignty-focused organizations, weâre turning encrypted inference into something teams can actually deploy and operate, not just experiment with.

Since Alan Turing's groundbreaking ideas in 1936, envisioning a machine capable of automatic mathematical operations, and John von Neumann's seminal proposal of the first computer architecture in 1945, we have witnessed the incredible capabilities of computers over the past 80 years. From the early stages of computing to the current era of 12-24 pipelined stages CPU architectures and billions of lines of code, our journey has been transformative. However, as we pushed the limits of Moore's Law and embraced faster CPU architectures, a bottleneck emergedâthe Von Neumann Bottleneck. Despite decades of innovation, the fundamental architecture itself presented limitations. This bottleneck inspired a new vision at Vicharakâa vision of overcoming constraints by introducing flexibility not just at the software level but fundamentally reshaping hardware in real-time. Our goal is to break free from the shackles of traditional CPU platforms by introducing Reconfigurable Computing to consumers. Imagine a world where hardware adapts to the specific needs of software on the fly, providing unprecedented speed and efficiency. This is the essence of our mission at Vicharak, Reconfigurable Computing. We are not only introducing Reconfigurable Computing to consumers but also pushing the boundaries further. What if we could run multiple parallel hardware instances, each reconfigurable, creating a truly Parallel Computing Machine as opposed to the sequential nature of traditional CPU architectures? At Vicharak, we are not just building computers; we are crafting the next generation of computing. Our approach involves a complete redefinition of computing architectures, software paradigms, and hardware capabilities. Our end goal is clearâto design a computing ecosystem that accelerates the speed and efficiency of day-to-day operations, liberatin...",

Incepted in the year 2015, Chimple Learning is an app from Sutara Learning Foundation, a non-profit organization dedicated to the foundational education of children. Chimple is a finalist in the Global Learning XPRIZE competition. ​ The competition challenged teams from around the world to develop open-source, scalable software that will enable children in developing countries to teach themselves basic reading, writing and arithmetic within 15 months. ​ With the help of UNESCO, a field trial of Chimple software was conducted for 15 months, during which children aged 7-10 showed impressive learning gains. Chimple is designed to bring high-quality learning experiences to all the students – regardless of access to school or other educational resources – Chimple app uses best practices and research in game design, pertaining to literacy and numeracy of early education, to support children’s engagement in learning. ​ Chimple app is an ideal mobile app for self-directed early learning for weaker sections of society of developing countries. ​ Our goal is to empower children to identify themselves as self-confident, independent learners with a lifelong passion for learning. We believe that harnessing the power of a computing device in the palm of a child will lead to an exponential growth in human knowledge. Chimple Learning app currently accelerates learning of reading, writing and mathematics in an interactive manner in regional language for children aged 3 to 8. Using Chimple Learning for Kids, children can become literate and well versed in basic education either on their own, or in a classroom. Chimple Story Srikanth Talapadi, the Founder of Chimple Learning in his own words mentioned that the team was inspired by Mahatma Gandhi’s outlook towards ‘simplicity.’ ​ Since the end product is going to be used by the children who do not know to read and...",

Together, let’s create a better tomorrow. Our Story At TeachBetter.ai, our journey began with a deep realization of the struggles faced by teachers, parents, and students in India’s education system. As educators and learners ourselves, we saw how the pressure of rote learning, excessive administrative tasks, and one-size-fits-all approaches were stifling creativity and the joy of learning. Teachers were burdened with time-consuming tasks, leaving little room to focus on nurturing young minds. Parents struggled to find the right tools to support their children, while students were caught in a system that often valued scores over curiosity. This motivated us to build TeachBetter.ai—a platform that combines the power of AI with the heart of education. Our Vision To lead the future of AI-powered education by fostering curiosity, critical thinking, and lifelong learning. We envision a world where students learn with joy, educators focus on inspiring, and classrooms become spaces of innovation and inclusion.

A Letter from Our CEO The world moves because of frontline workers. Organizations thrive because of frontline workers. They sell, deliver, service, install, and support-the ones who keep the wheels turning every single day. Yet this workforce often lacks the tools they need to be truly enabled, productive, and successful. Today, nearly 80% of every organizationâs employees work in frontline roles. And yet, most workplace tools are built for the knowledge workforce, leaving the frontline largely ignored. At Hunar.AI, we are committed to changing that-to enable 1 billion frontline workers globally with AI-native tools. We believe conversation is the key to engagement for a workforce that is decentralized, distributed, and hyperlocal. By leveraging Voice AI, we are powering conversations that bridge the gap between organizations and their workforce. These conversations unlock true potential: better hiring, faster onboarding, improved productivity, and stronger retention. But innovation without responsibility is incomplete. That is why we are deeply committed to Ethical AI-building technology that is fair, transparent, multilingual, and inclusive, ensuring dignity and opportunity for every frontline worker we touch. As a team of generalists, we approach this as a business-critical problem-our product is built to be practical, scalable, and deeply rooted in solving real-world frontline challenges. At the same time, as a team of PhDs, engineers, and innovators, we are at the cutting edge of Voice AI innovation, designing tools that make conversation the cornerstone of workforce management.

After every use, missed spots remained, particularly in those hard-to-reach areas. But the problem wasn't just physical, it was a lack of intelligence. The vacuum didn't know what it needed to clean or where it needed to go. That frustration sparked an idea. What if machines could think better? What if they could learn their environments and adapt? That idea became the foundation of Spotless AI. Our Ultimate Goal At Spotless AI, we believe in one simple truth: machines can be much smarter. Whether it's a household appliance or a large-scale industrial system, we're transforming the way machines work by infusing them with cutting-edge artificial intelligence. Our goal is to make machines not just efficient, but truly intelligent with lesser manual intervention. What sets us apart is a passionate team of experts drives our innovation, and we're proud to be affiliated with some of the world's leading associations. Together, we're redefining the future of automation, ensuring that our solutions lead the way in efficiency and effectiveness. What We Set Out To Do Spotless AI's mission is simple yet powerful: to improve the efficiency of disinfection and other industrial processes through intelligent automation.

Yet, despite their immense potential, only 14% of these businesses have access to formal credit. The remaining 86% struggle—not because they lack ambition or capability, but because they lack access to a critical financial lifeline. Every day, more than 60% of loan applications are rejected due to fragmented financial data, insufficient credit history, or lack of preparation. These rejections cost businesses precious time, growth opportunities, and, in the worst cases, their very survival. At OneNDF , we believe this status quo is unacceptable. What We Do One Account, Endless Possibilities We are India’s first credit profile builder for SMEs , engineered to ensure that no small business misses out on funding due to preventable barriers. Our platform integrates four key financial pillars —credit bureau data, financial statements, GST records, and banking data—to build a dynamic and comprehensive credit profile for your business.

Company registration in India legally establishes a business under the applicable laws for its structure.

CurlSek exists to make security continuous, contextual, and outcome-drivenâso it can finally move at the pace of your systems and your team. 01 We exist to change how security is understood and valuedânot by layering more tools, but by closing the gaps that matter. Security today is episodic, compliance-driven, and reactive. We're making it continuous, contextual, and outcome-driven. 02 â What we believe Continuous, not point-in-time Security must run alongside development and operations. One-off assessments leave gaps the moment systems change. Drive decisions, not block them When security is opaque or adversarial, it gets deprioritized. It should inform trade-offsânot shut them down. Understandable beyond security teams Leaders, engineers, and boards need to act on risk without decoding jargon. Clarity is a prerequisite for action. Measurable in business terms Risk reduced, money saved, audit stress lowered. Security value should resonate in the boardroom. 03 â The gap Security leaders struggle to be heard. Risk is hard to quantify in ways that compete for budget and board attention. Security is rarely prioritized until something goes wrongâand even then, it's framed as cost, not value. Episodic testing, compliance-first priorities, and a lack of shared language between security and business keep that gap wide. 04 â How we think We think differently. Contextual security Connecting findings to your environment and business impactânot raw lists. Risk â outcomes Translating risk into dollars, prioritization, and decisions so security informs roadmaps. Value preservation Reframing security as money saved and value protectedânot something that blocks or slows. 05 Security for everyone. Most organizations don't have dedicated security teams.

      "about_content": "Spark Connect Overview - Spark 4.1.1 Documentation Spark Connect Overview Building client-side Spark applications In Apache Spark 3.4, Spark Connect introduced a decoupled client-server architecture that allows remote connectivity to Spark clusters using the DataFrame API and unresolved logical plans as the protocol. The separation between client and server allows Spark and its open ecosystem to be leveraged from everywhere. It can be embedded in modern data applications, in IDEs, Notebooks and programming languages. To get started, see Quickstart: Spark Connect . How Spark Connect works The Spark Connect client library is designed to simplify Spark application development. It is a thin API that can be embedded everywhere: in application servers, IDEs, notebooks, and programming languages. The Spark Connect API builds on Spark’s DataFrame API using unresolved logical plans as a language-agnostic protocol between the client and the Spark driver. The Spark Connect client translates DataFrame operations into unresolved logical query plans which are encoded using protocol buffers. These are sent to the server using the gRPC framework. The Spark Connect endpoint embedded on the Spark Server receives and translates unresolved logical plans into Spark’s logical plan operators. This is similar to parsing a SQL query, where attributes and relations are parsed and an initial parse plan is built. From there, the standard Spark execution process kicks in, ensuring that Spark Connect leverages all of Spark’s optimizations and enhancements. Results are streamed back to the client through gRPC as Apache Arrow-encoded row batches. How Spark Connect client applications differ from classic Spark applications One of the main design goals of Spark Connect is to enable a full separation and isolation of the client from the server. As a consequence, there are some changes that developers need to be aware of when using Spark Connect: The client does not run in the same process as the Spar...",

With a bold creative outlook and the capacity to handle large-scale productions, Exosphere seeks to push beyond the traditional scope of Dutch filmmaking and compete on an international stage. Harald Swinkels, founder of Exosphere, is an award-winning writer, director, and producer. His debut short Drawback (2024), featuring Claes Bang, established his approach: psychologically complex narratives exploring moral ambiguity through mesmerizing visual craft. Drawback earned Swinkels 33 international festival awards. As producer on the Tribeca-winning Beyond Silence (2025), he navigates the responsibilities of bringing fragile, necessary stories to the screen. Odessa (2025) escalates his vision - a 35mm period piece that explores the human capacity for kindness and cruelty, set against one of the darkest periods in human history and the haunting beauty of the Dolomites. Swinkels' work aspires to transcend borders, leaving audiences with ideas that linger long after the credits roll. Rianne Beenes is a young producer with an extensive background in live events, cultural initiatives, and international productions. Her work has consistently required balancing creative vision with high-end execution — from coordinating complex logistics to collaborating with demanding stakeholders and managing budgets under tight timelines. Known for her adaptability and poise, she brings a fresh perspective and strong organizational expertise to Exosphere’s film slate, where she is currently producing several projects in development. exosphere 2025.

Instead of swiping or inserting a standard bank card, you can make transactions with the quick tap of a contactless bank card. Contactless cards have this symbol Contactless payment symbol on the front or back. If you see this symbol on your card, you can tap it at OMNY readers at subway stations and on buses to make fare payments and enter the system. Many banks and financial institutions have started switching to contactless cards to make payments faster and more secure for their customers. If you do not have a contactless card today, you can request one from your bank or financial institution. You can also link a non-contactless card to a digital wallet and use it with your smart device. Keep scrolling to learn more about digital wallets. Learn more about digital wallets Digital wallets are mobile applications that allow you to make payments with smart devices, such as your smart phone, smart watch, or wearable. Like contactless cards, smart devices also use contactless technology. Before you can make fare payments with your smart device at OMNY readers , you will need to add your bank card to your digital wallet. If you have more than one card linked to your digital wallet, make sure to choose which card you want to use before you tap it at an OMNY reader. Otherwise, the OMNY reader will use the default card linked to your digital wallet. You may need to unlock your smart device to use your digital wallet. Refer to the user guides and settings for your smart device and digital wallet to learn more. When you add your bank card to your digital wallet, it will create a device account number. The device account number is different for each smart device that you use. The last four digits of each device account number will appear in your OMNY account when you tap your smart device at OMNY readers . Choose how to pay and be o...",

A decade in public health didn’t prepare me for postpartum. When my baby arrived, nothing felt “normal.” I was overwhelmed, exhausted, and navigating motherhood without traditional family support. My husband wanted to help, but like so many new fathers, he didn’t always know how. And between sleepless nights and recovery pains, I had no time to care for myself. What hurt the most was being dismissed. “It’s normal.” “It will pass.” But it didn’t feel normal.I felt unseen, unheard, and completely alone. VivaMama was born from that pain and possibility. From my own lived experience and the countless stories of women who shared the same struggle, I created VivaMama as a space where mothers feel supported, validated, and cared for with science-based guidance and genuine empathy. Postpartum is not something to “get through.” It is a phase that deserves care. At VivaMama, your wellbeing comes first – personal, evidence-backed, and without judgment. Get Started Today Our approach Care that’s with you at every step From the first days after birth to the months ahead, we guide you with practical, gentle support, so your postpartum journey feels calmer, clearer, and more confident. Our Mission To help new mothers feel supported and empowered. We combine expert guidance, AI tools, and community support to make breastfeeding, recovery, and emotional well-being easier so you can focus on bonding with your baby. Our Vision A world where no mother feels alone after birth. We imagine the fourth trimester as a time of healing, joy, and connection, where every mother and baby thrives together with the right care and guidance. Partnerships & Recognition Strengthened by leading institutions who believe in our mission Incubated at IIM Bangalore's NSRCEL and supported by the UP Government Seed Fund and MEITY Tide 2.0, VivaMama has been honored by TiE Women, Leap to Unicorn...",

Request Pilot Trusted By The Problem Industrial teams do not lack data or tools. They lack memory.

Our mission Our goal is to provide people with disabilities affordable solutions that enable them to live their life with mobility, and to enable them to communicate, create and work independently. Safety is our priority. We’ve been working closely with healthcare and rehabilitation professionals from the start – their relevant insights helped us to ensure that our products are not only safe but require the least amount of training possible. We believe in innovation. We believe disabled people should have access to 21-st century technologies, and they shouldn’t have to rely on outdated mechanical products that are uncomfortable, hard to use, and require months of training. Design matters. We believe mobility products should and can have a discrete and smooth design, and that users should feel comfortable wearing them out there on the daily. A few of the amazing companies who trust NOWtech How it started In 2013 our founder Marton had to move to a temporary accommodation near the Rehabilitation Centre for Physically Disabled People in Budapest, Hungary. So his path often crossed with the people living there. He was shocked to see so many people with high-level spine injuries rolling the streets with bulky, cumbersome and visibly uncomfortable solutions such as chin joysticks and pointer sticks. As an inventor and tech enthusiast, he found it unacceptable that disabled patients don’t have access to today’s technologies, and are depending on such industrial, mechanic equipment. He built the first prototype of our proportional headset almost overnight and after showing it to the leaders of the center, they not only gave Marton their feedback, but also a space in the institution’s workshop and provided wheelchairs for further development.
